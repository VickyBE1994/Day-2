Differance between window and document object 
      DOCUMENT
         * It is loaded inside the window
        *It is the object of window property
        *All the elemements with atributes in HTML are part of the document
       *We can access the document from a window using a window.document
        *The document is part of BOM & DOM
        *Properties of document objects such as title ,body,cokies,etc can also be accesed by a window
        like this window.document.title
        syntax:
               document.propertyname
        example:
        document title :will return the title of the document

        WINDOW
             * It is the very first object that is loaded in the browser
             *It is the object of the browser
             *Global object functions and variable of javascript are members of the window object
             We can access the window from the window only i.e window.window
             *The window part of BOM not a DOM
             *Properties of window object can't be accesed by the document object
                   Syntax:
                          window.property name 
                      
                Example:  
                          window.innerHeight:will return the height of the content area of the browser
